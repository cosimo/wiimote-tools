=====================================================

A small set of simple and funny scripts that are
meant to be used with a Nintendo Wiimote controller.


* wiimote-conductor

    Can control the speed of a movie or song by pretending to
    use the wiimote like a orchestra conductor would.

    It's a bit sucky because it doesn't get the actual tempo
    from the sound, so you have to pretend the normal (1.0x) speed
    is represented by wii-beats distanced by 1 second.

    So if you want to double the speed of the movie/song, you
    have to move the wii in the air every 0.5 seconds.

    Pretty lame, eh? :)

    Requires 'Audio::Play::MPlayer' with a patch to add
    the 'speed' command.

* wiimote-drumkit

    This is something I made for my small kids, so they could
    just play with sounds. You can write a small config file to
    assign random mp3s/wav/... to each button of the wii.
 
    Take a look at drumkit.conf or animals.conf as examples.

    Then each time you press a button, or wave the wii in the air
    (pretending you're playing drums), you will hear the corresponding
    sounds.

    Requires 'paplay'.

* wiimote-joystick

    This is a quick hack that I put together to use the wiimote
    together with any of my favorite games as a digital joystick.

    I can use it to play with mame, of course with legal roms
    or c64 emulators (with games I of course owned when I was a kid)
    and so on.

    Currently it works well with a few games, because of the way the
    keys are sent to X11, and it works really bad with other games,
    because of the way the keys are sent to X11.

    Requires 'X11::GUITest', install with 'sudo cpan X11::GUITest'.
